# Golang Database Integration Tests with Docker

Topics:

* Using [ory/dockertest](https://github.com/ory/dockertest) Go package for integration tests using Docker.
* Using Docker to manually verify `Go Get` and `brew install` installations commands for a Go application.
* Running tests coverage reports from within Golang \(and build tags\).
